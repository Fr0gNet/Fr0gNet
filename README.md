# Fr0gNet


### Fr0g v0.1.0

Fr0g is an application/layer protocol build on Stellar that enables a decentralized web file system for uncensorable ID-addressed websites and content
and turns the network into a global, censorship-resistant data layer where content can’t be altered or taken down by third parties.


### fr0g IDs
Think of a fr0g ID as a "decentralized domain":
- Anyone with the ID can view the content (no login or special client required).
- Only the holder of the corresponding secret key can modify or delete it.
- Everything is on-chain → public, verifiable, censorship-resistant and impossible for third parties to remove.
IDs are deterministic, globally resolvable, and independent of any specific client implementation.

### How to create one (step-by-step)

1. Clone the repository (it contains the core in pure Python):

```
git clone https://github.com/Fr0gNet/Fr0gNet
cd Fr0gNet/core
```

2. Open Python (3.8+ is fine, no heavy external dependencies):

```
python3
```

3. Generate your fr0g ID + secret key:

```python
import fr0g

fr0g_ID, fr0g_secret = fr0g.random_keypair(enabled=True)
print("Your fr0g ID:", fr0g_ID)
print("Your secret key (save it!):", fr0g_secret)
```

- fr0g_ID → share this with anyone
- fr0g_secret → keep it secret, it's your "password" to edit

### How to publish content (upload)

Classic example — upload a simple HTML page as default (index=0):

```python
import fr0g

# (use the fr0g_secret you generated earlier)

html = b"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>My first fr0g</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Hello from Fr0gNet!</h1>
<p>This is immutable and on-chain.</p>
</body>
</html>
"""

fr0g.upload(html, fr0g_secret, index=0)
print("Published! Now anyone with the ID can see it.")
```

- index=0 → default content (like index.html)
- You can upload multiple files with different indexes (1, 2, 3…) → e.g. images, json, css
- To delete a file: fr0g.upload(b'', fr0g_secret, index=0)
- To edit: simply upload new content to the same index
- Limit: total ≤ 60 KB per fr0g ID (sum of all indexes)

### How to view / resolve a fr0g ID

Easiest method (no software installation needed)  
Go to: [https://Fr0gNet.github.io/browser.html  ](https://fr0gnet.github.io/Fr0gNet/frontend/browser)
Paste your fr0g ID into the field and press Go / Enter.

From Python (for testing or scripting):

```python
content = fr0g.get_content(fr0g_ID)
print(content) # bytes
print(content.decode('utf-8')) # if it's text/HTML
```

Via "fr0g leap" (magic embedded links in HTML)  
You can create links that open fr0g content directly even from normal pages or local files:

```html
<a href="javascript:void(0)"
fr0g-ID="fr0g2fi7jofxqjfayl7o7pkanes7xjsgijylbbud4atm6v2vp2mq4mjapnbg"
onclick="/* code generated by the Fr0gnNet Browser */">
Enter my fr0g!
</a>
```

The Fr0gNet Browser (https://fr0gnet.github.io/Fr0gNet/frontend/browser)

generates the onclick code (Leap) for you when you browse an ID.

### Quick summary – typical workflow

1. fr0g_ID, secret = fr0g.random_keypair(enabled=True)
2. Write your HTML / JSON / data
3. fr0g.upload(your_content, secret, index=0)
4. Share only the ID
5. Anyone opens it via https://Fr0gNet.github.io/browser.html or compatible clients
6. You can always edit using the secret

Fr0gNet is designed to be extremely simple (single Python file), permissionless and server-free.  
If you want static sites, rebel landing pages, manifestos, immutable pastebins or mini on-chain JSON APIs → this is exactly what it's for.

### On-chain Data Model
fr0g encodes application state, file references, and metadata directly on-chain using Stellar transactions.
Once published, data becomes:
* **immutable**
* **publicly verifiable**
* **censorship-resistant**
Clients interpret this data according to fr0g’s logic
---
### Clients
fr0g is **client-agnostic** by design.
Any program, application, or script that follows the protocol can act as a fr0g client.
Official apps like Fr0gNet are provided for convenience, but:

* no client is privileged

* no client is required

* the protocol remains fully permissionless

---
### Security & Trust Model
* Stellar provides consensus, ordering, and finality
* fr0g adds semantic meaning at the application layer
* Trust is minimized to cryptographic verification and protocol rules
* No centralized infrastructure is required to read or publish data
